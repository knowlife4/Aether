Atmospheric Volumetric Fog/Lights for Unity URP

Aether provides atmospheric volumetric fog and lighting effects to the Unity Universal Render Pipeline.

This project allows developers to easily create immersive and realistic atmospheric conditions in their games, such as fog, mist, and haze, which can significantly enhance the overall aesthetic of a scene.
